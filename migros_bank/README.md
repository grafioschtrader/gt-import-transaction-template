## Work progress

### What is missing
For a robust review of the import templates, the possible variants of CSV and PDF documents from different Swissquote customers are missing.
- PDF documents of transactions with bonds are missing.

## PDF documents
Importing transactions with the appropriate import template should work.

## CSV documents
For the following reasons, the motivation for creating an import template of CSV documents has been missing so far.
- CSV documents inadequate due to lack of information such as fees, etc. for **securities transactions**. 
- The import of account transactions has not been considered yet, therefore there is no implementation.
